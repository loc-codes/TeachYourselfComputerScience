# Discussion 5 - Iterators & Iterables
## Subtype Polymorphism
- Allows us to use subtype of a class or interface in its place so we
can write functions that can operate on a wide array of objects, so  
long as they have a certain attribute in common
 
## Exceptions
- Used to stop the code and inform the person running it when 
something occurs that is not allowed
        - eg: NullPointerException
- You can throw or catch exceptions

## Iterators and Iterables
- Iterators are objects that can be iterated through. It has two 
methods  
        - boolean hasNext()
        - T next()
- Iterables are objects that can produce an iterator
