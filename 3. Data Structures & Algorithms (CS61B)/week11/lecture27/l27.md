# Lecture 27 - Software Engineering
- This lecture focuses on how to deal with the "large scale"

## Complexity Defined
### The Power of Software
- Software is unconstrained from laws of physics - complexity is the limit
    - Your mind/understanding is also the limit
- In short, the greatest limitation we face in building systems is being able to understand what we're building!
    - Not true for other Engineers eg: Civil Engineers have to worry about strength of concrete

### Complexity - The Enemy
- Our greatest limitation is simply understand the system we're trying to build
- As real programs are worked on, they gain more features and complexity
    - Over time, it becomes difficult for programmers to understand all the relevant pieces to make feature modifications
    - Debuggers, tests etc make it easier to deal with complexity
- ABOVE ALL, KEEP YOUR SOFTWARE SIMPLE!

### Dealing with Complexity
- Two approaches to managing complexity
    - Making code simpler and more obvious
        - eg: eliminate special cases 
        - Handling a singly linked list with add Last on a empty list
            - We could have used a special cases, but sentinal nodes are better for managing complexity
    - Encapsulation into modules
        - In a modular design, creator of one module can use another module withouting knowing how they work
        - Remember the cave analogy, and how you usually interact with lists/dicts
            - You don't need to know if its an AList/Hashmap

### Nature of Complexity
- Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system, that makes it hard to understand and modify

- Takes many forms:
    - Understanding how code works
    - The amount of time it takes to make small improvements
    - Fining what needs to be modified to make improvement
    - Difficult to fix one bug without introducing another

- "If a software system is hard to understand and modify, it is complicated. If its easy, its simple"

- Cost view of compleity
    - Complex systems: to make change, it takes a lot more time/understanding. High cost

- Complexity is not synonymous with a large system
    - Complexity can occur in small modules/systems

### Indicators of Complexity
- Repeated Code
- Redunancy
- Hard coded values
- Special cases
- No comments/documentation

### Complexity and Importance
- Complexity depends on how often a piece of a system is modified
    - A system may have a few pieces that are highly complex, but if nobody ever looks at it, impact is minimal
        - Eg: You would optimise Java's built in HashMap at the expense of complexity as it won't change much

## Symptoms and Causes of Complexity
### Symptoms of Complexity
- The 3 symptoms of complexity
    1. Change amplification: A simple change requires modification in many places
    2. Cognitive Load: How much do you need to know in order to make a change
        - Not the same as number lines of codes. Often more lines of code makes code more narrative/simpler
    3. Unknown unknowns
        - The worst type of complexity
        - When its not even clear what you need to change to make modifications

### Obvious Systems
- In a good design, a system is ideally obvious
- In an obvious sytem, to make a change a developer can:
    - Quickly understand how existing code works
    - Come up with a proposed change without doing too much thinking
    - You will have a high confidence that a change will actually work

### Complexity Comes Slowly
