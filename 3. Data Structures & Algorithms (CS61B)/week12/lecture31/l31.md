# Lecture 31 - Software Engineering II
## Ousterhout's Take on Complexity
- 2 primary soures of complexity:
  - Dependencies: When a piece of code cannot be read, understood and modified independently
  - Obscrurity: When important information is not obvious

## Modular Design
### Hiding Complexity
- One powerful tool for managing complexity is to design your system so that a programmer in only thinking about some of the complexity at once
  - Can't hold everything in your head
  
### Modular Design
- In an ideal world, system would be broken down into modules, where every module would be totally independent
  - Here, "module" is an informal term referring to a class, a apackage or other unit of code
  - Not possible for module to be entirely independent, because code from each module has to call other modules
  
### Interface vs Implementation
- As we've seen, theres an important distinction between interface/adt and implementation
  - "The best modules are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementation"
  - If a module's interface is simple, we can change an implementation of that module without affecting the interface
    - If a List interface had an arraySuze method, this would limit the implementation to an array. The user doesn't need to know what List is used
### Interface
- Formal part: The list of method signatures
- Informal part: Rules for using the interface that are not enfored by the compiler
  - eg: If method throws an exception on null inuts, that is informal 
    - You need to add this to documentation

### Modules should be deep
- "The best modules are those that provide powerful funtionality, yet have simple interface. This is a deep module"
- For example, the KdTree is a depp module with a complex implementation
  - But simple interface
  - In my work, same (I assume), with playwright and beautiful soup
  
### Information Hiding
- The most important way to make your moduiles deep is to practice information hiding
  - Embded knowledge and design decision in the module itself

## Information Leaking
- The opposite of information hiding is information leakage
- Occurs when a design decision is reflected in multiple modules
  - Any change to one requires a change to all
- Eg: Two move methods exist that process input in the same way
- Information leakage is one of the most important red flags in software design
- One of the best skills you can learn as a software designer is a high level of sensitivity to information leakage

### Temporal Decomposition
- One of the biggest causes of information leakage is temporal decomposition
  - The structure of the system rfelcts the order in which events occur

- Suggestions before you start writing codr
  - Think through and build classes/interfaces needed in manay place of your code
- Then create "deep modules" of simple interfaces that do complicated things
- Ultimately, be strategic not tactical AND hide information from yourself
