## Subject 2: Discrete Mathematics
### Aim to build a working understanding of logic, combinatorics and probability, set theory, graph theory, and a little of the number theory informing cryptography.

"Our suggested starting point for discrete mathematics is the set of lecture notes by L치szl칩 Lov치sz. 
Professor Lov치sz did a good job of making the content approachable and intuitive, so this serves as a better starting point than more formal texts."

In following the advice from teachyourselfcs.com, I am self-teaching using the lecture notes. This is not as in depth as I could go, but I am aiming to get a basic understanding of the math underpinning Data Structures & Algorithms.

I have learnt probability and linear algebra when I studying Economics and Math electives at uni, so I do not need to cover these.
