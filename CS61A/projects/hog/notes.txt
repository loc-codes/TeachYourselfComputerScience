Two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with GOAL points
Goal defaults to 100
Player chooses number of dice to roll, up to 10. Scores the sum of the outcomes
If any dice returns a 1, the score for turn is 1 (Sow Sad)

Boar Brawl. A player who rolls zero dice scores three times the absolute difference between the 
tens digit of the opponent’s score and the ones digit of the current player’s score, or 1, whichever is higher.

Fuzzy Factors: A fuzzy number is any number n where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and 100 is greater than 10. 
Recall that the GCD of a and b is the largest factor that is shared between both numbers (for example, the GCD of 10 and 15 is 5). 
After a player gains points for their turn, if their resulting score is a fuzzy number, add two times the tens digit of the GCD to the player's score.

Eg: A player has 14 points and rolls 2 dice that total 6 points. Their new score would be 20, and since 20 is a fuzzy number (the GCD of 20 and 100 is 20), 
their score is increased to 20 + 2 * 2 = 24.
