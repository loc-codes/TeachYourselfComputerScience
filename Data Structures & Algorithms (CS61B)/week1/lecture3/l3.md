# Lecture 3 - Testing
- This lecture will write tests for a sorting method
- We will write testSort first, before we write sort (TDD)
- Tests provide stability and scaffolding - reduce complexity held in your brain

###  JUnit new syntax:
- assertArrayEquals, assertEquals, assertFalse
- assertEquals: Tests that expected equals actual
- @org.junit.Test - uses junit runner to run all tests
- use imports instead of org.junit.Test - see test file
- Unit testing builds confidence in helper methods and modules

### TDD
- Identify new feature
- Write a unit test for feature
- Run the test - it should fail
- Write code that passes test
- Optimise/refactor code and keep green

### Integration Testing
- Test many units at once, and test they interact as expected
